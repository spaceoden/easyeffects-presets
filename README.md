# My presets for Easy Effects
The intent of these presets is to maintain consistent volume and compress dynamic range, so quiet sounds are closer in volume to loud sounds. This helps with understanding speech and reduces the risk of ear damage.

These are based on [Digitalone1's LoudnessEqualizer preset](https://github.com/Digitalone1/EasyEffects-Presets). I disliked the gate, multiband compressor, and EQ, so I removed those. The multiband compressor has been replaced with a standard compressor.

Crossfeed+Compressor adds a crossfeed to make stereo panning milder. Useful for headphones.
