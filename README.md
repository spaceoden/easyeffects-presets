These are based on [Digitalone1's LoudnessEqualizer preset](https://github.com/Digitalone1/EasyEffects-Presets). I disliked the gate, multiband compressor, and eq, so I removed those. The multiband compressor has been replaced with a standard compressor.
Crossfeed+Compressor adds a crossfeed to make stereo panning milder. Useful for headphones.
